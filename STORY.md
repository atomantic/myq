# The MyQ Vision

I'm a busy developer. Along with my personal goals and family life, I have a lot of tasks at work. Someone comes up to my desk and says, "Got a minute?" Do I? This visitor wants to add a task to my plate. How do I give an accurate estimate of when I will be able to tackle that task? I'd love to be able to say, "Yes, I can have that done next Tuesday at 3pm" but my gut idea of when I can deliver this with my constant shifting of priorities, meetings, and randomizing back-burner supporting tasks is simply unrealistic.

Today, requests like this go through a gatekeeper in the form of a tool like Jira, a typical Agile process management application. The request comes in, gets put into intake, waits for review, gets and estimate, maybe makes it into the plan, gets assigned to someone and then someone can provide a date that it might get done. This is all accomplished in a long, tedious process that often leaves work permanently in the backlog. The backlog is full of features, bugs, and improvements that are not assigned to anyone, many of which will never make it onto someone’s actual plate of work.

As a product owner, how do I know how long it will take to get through my backlog? If I hire 2 developers with a particular skill-set, will that be enough? Do I even know what skills are required to tackle all of those items? What if 90% of my backlog can only be fulfilled by the skills of 10% of my team?

Enter MyQ, a personal queue management system that can be linked with other team members to form a real-time, automatically estimated and assigned queue of work. No more backlog black hole. No more guessing at when work will be done. Using the power of kanban workflow and an automated prioritization AI that accounts for real-time interruptions like meetings, new hire onboarding, interviewing, trainings, vacation time, sick days and more, MyQ reports exactly how busy each member of your team is, what's interrupting the next task in the queue and where a new request will fit onto the stack, all while constantly evaluating and shifting tasks as new information pours in and time passes.

Each task comes into the queue tagged with skills required to complete the task, the request is then automatically load balanced onto a team member who can get it done the soonest. Tasks are automatically re-organized and load balanced to optimize team efficiency and re-evaluate priorities as items are changed. No longer does the product have a team backlog. Every task is assigned and given an estimation date based on analysis of the assignee’s ability to get work done and future conflicts that will arise.

MyQ Analytics reports exactly where the team needs help and who is overloaded. The dashboard allows simple inspection and reporting on what tasks are "below the fold"--tasks that will never be done unless priorities shift or more resources with a particular skill are added to the team.

Now the product owner knows exactly how many people to hire and for how long. Anyone asking for a feature will know immediately and reliably when it will get done (or if it's currently below the fold). Now a requestor knows exactly what tasks are in front of their request and who they need to talk to in order to get priorities shifted.

But MyQ doesn't stop there. This is a family of products that goes from enterprise, to small and home business, to personal life and goal management. While the market for MyQ begins as a highly targeted arena, the actual market for MyQ is everyone.

The primary profit market is Enterprise software development teams. The secondary profit market is small business owners. An independent photographer building her business, needs daily business practices and routines. MyQ Pro, using the MyQ Assistant AI, builds, prompts and schedules a daily routine of success with a gamified experience.

Just as video games encourage individuals to level up characters and earn rewards for daily practice, MyQ rewards users for building success and getting stuff done. Check it out! My wife is a level 12 photographer. She worked on her business every day this week; she gets recognized. She sees results not only in intangible gamification; her business is growing and she sees it in her pocketbook.

The third phase of MyQ is a personal goal management platform that prioritizes and helps accomplish life goals. It's not just a “to do” list, it's the ultimate bucket list with social recognition, a mentor network, daily routines, task breakdown and personal calendar management.

How are you going to accomplish everything you really want to accomplish? Are you unwittingly giving up your goals for menial tasks? You need a queue management system with a beautiful interface, backed by a computationally strong assistant AI.

MyQ is that system.
